# Green AI - Smart Product Analysis Pipeline

An end-to-end pipeline for product label analysis using OCR, object detection, and MongoDB storage. Built with FastAPI, supports Tesseract and EasyOCR, YOLOv8 object detection, image quality enhancement, and a modern frontend.

---

## Features

- **Image Upload & Camera Support**: Upload product images or capture via camera (frontend ready, see `index.html`).
- **OCR**: Extracts text using Tesseract and EasyOCR (auto-selects best result).
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8-based detection of packaging types (bottle, can, box, etc.) and material guessing.
- **Image Quality Metrics**: Computes blur, brightness, and contrast; attempts enhancement for marginal images.
- **MongoDB Storage**: Stores OCR results, image info, and analytics in MongoDB (with GridFS support).
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Minimal in-memory metrics endpoint for monitoring.
- **Docker Support**: Ready-to-deploy Dockerfile for easy containerization.
- **Testing**: Pytest-based API tests for upload, validation, and error handling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Pillow
- pytesseract
- easyocr
- pymongo
- motor
- python-multipart
- loguru
- pytest
- ultralytics (for YOLOv8)

See `requirements.txt` for details. You may need to install system dependencies for Tesseract and OpenCV (see Dockerfile for reference).

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## MongoDB Setup

- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible (default: `mongodb://localhost:27017`).
- For image storage, GridFS is used (handled by pymongo/motor).
- You can override DB connection via `MONGO_URI` and `MONGO_DB` environment variables.

---

## Running the API

### Local (development)

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### With Docker

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t ocr-pipeline .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e MONGO_URI="mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017" \
  -e MONGO_DB=ocr_pipeline \
  -v $(pwd)/yolov8n.pt:/app/yolov8n.pt \
  ocr-pipeline
```

*Note: Adjust `MONGO_URI` as needed for your environment. The YOLOv8 weights file (`yolov8n.pt`) must be present in the project root and mounted into the container.*

---

## API Endpoints

### `POST /ocr`

**Description:**
Analyze a product image for text and packaging type.

**Request:**
- `file`: image (JPEG/PNG, ≤5MB, multipart form-data)
- `source`: (optional) string, e.g. 'upload' or 'camera'
- `retake_count`: (optional) int, number of retakes

**Response:**
- On success:
  - `status`: "success"
  - `engine_used`: "Tesseract" or "Easyocr"
  - `full_text`: cleaned OCR text
  - `structured_text`: dict with product_name, ingredients, features, other_info
  - `object_detection`: list of detected objects with class, bounding box, confidence, material guess
  - `quality`: blur, brightness, contrast
- On failure:
  - `status`: "fail"
  - `error`: error message
  - `object_detection`: always present (may be empty)

### `GET /metrics`

Returns recent API usage and performance metrics (in-memory, for dashboard).

---

## Testing

Run all tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

Test coverage includes:
- Valid image upload and OCR
- Invalid file type handling
- Large file rejection

See `tests/test_api.py` for details.

---

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -F "file=@tests/sample1.jpg" http://localhost:8000/ocr
```

---

## Codebase Overview

- **app/main.py**: FastAPI app, endpoints, and metrics logger. Handles `/ocr` and `/metrics` endpoints, image validation, preprocessing, OCR, object detection, and DB logging.
- **app/ocr.py**: Runs OCR using Tesseract and EasyOCR, returns cleaned and structured text.
- **app/object_detection.py**: Loads YOLOv8 model, detects packaging objects, and guesses material type.
- **app/db.py**: Async MongoDB integration using Motor, stores OCR results and analytics.
- **app/utils.py**: Image validation, preprocessing, enhancement, and quality metrics (blur, brightness, contrast).
- **app/text_processing.py**: Cleans and structures OCR text into product name, ingredients, features, and other info.
- **app/logger.py**: Configures Loguru logging for the app.
- **index.html**: Modern frontend UI for uploads and camera capture (see comments in file for JS logic).
- **tests/**: Pytest-based API tests and sample files for validation.

---

## Notes

- For best results, upload clear, well-lit images of product labels.
- If the image is blurry or dark, the API will attempt enhancement before OCR.
- MongoDB is required for persistent storage; for stateless demo/testing, comment out DB calls in `app/db.py`.
- YOLOv8 model weights (`yolov8n.pt`) must be present in the project root.
- System dependencies for Tesseract and OpenCV may be required (see Dockerfile).
